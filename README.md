# Advanced_RAG_CODE

Explanation:

Vector Database:
FAISS is used to efficiently store and search document embeddings.
Embeddings are generated using OpenAIEmbeddings.
Reranking:
The reranker function reorders the retrieved documents based on their similarity to the query.
You can replace cosine_similarity with a more advanced reranker model for better results.
RetrievalQA Chain:
The RetrievalQA chain combines retrieval and generation.
It retrieves relevant documents using the vector database and reranker.
It then passes the most relevant documents to the LLM for answer generation.
Key Improvements:

Efficiency: Vector databases significantly speed up document retrieval compared to linear search.
Accuracy: Reranking improves the quality of retrieved documents, leading to more accurate and relevant answers.
Contextualization: The LLM generates responses based on the most relevant information, resulting in more informative and accurate outputs.
This advanced RAG code provides a solid foundation for building more sophisticated and effective RAG systems. You can further customize it by:

Experimenting with different vector databases, embedding models, and reranker models.
Fine-tuning the LLM for specific tasks or domains.
Incorporating additional features like multi-hop retrieval, question answering over multiple documents, and more.
